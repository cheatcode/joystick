cli/buildFiles:

- Keep track of files changed
- Let restartApplicationProcess handle call to HMR clients. This way we can guarantee everything is ready AND we only fire the HMR call ONCE.

cli/hmrServer:

- [x] Keep track of connections on the process object.

node/hmr/client:

- When a message comes in, detect the file type
  - Any JS files should trigger a re-mount
  - Any CSS should be handled in the same way as before
  - Any HTML/settings should be handled in the same way as before

  Other stuff:

  - Clean up get path variations so it doesn't include generics like "index" for index.server.js, etc.

  - Look at getCodependenciesForFile and make sure you're not over-scoped to other files.
